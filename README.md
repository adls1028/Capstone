<b> The artifact I have chosen to complete all three enhancements is my Weight Tracking app from the Mobile Architecture course. <br><br></b>

For the initial enhancement of this application, I chose to overhaul the user interface of the app as well as assess the code for proper formatting. I also added in multiple new Toast messages for user confirmation. <br>

For the second enhancement, I implemented my knowledge of algorithms to create a sorting algorithm within the database. This made it so all weights added to the database were automatically sorted by the date of the weight, not the date the weight was added. <br><br>

For the final enhancement, I improved the database by making it more robust. I added delete and edit features throughout the database and allowed data to be stored under multiple usernames.<br><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94a67d50-c4d5-411b-8691-1b4a09d431e8" width="250">

<h1>Professional Self-Assessment</h1><br>
The time I have spent in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University has overall shaped my professional goals and values, as well as prepared me for entering the computer science field once I graduate. Although I do not plan to enter the Computer Science world directly, but instead am working towards becoming a Project Manager, I feel that all I have learned in this program has helped me gain a better overall understanding of the Computer Science field which I hope to work in. While this project does not reflect all I have worked on during my degree program, I feel that it shows a good understanding of my Software Design, Algorithm, and Database knowledge. <br><br>

The application I have chosen to feature as my artifact is a Weight Tracking application that was initially created in the Mobile Architecture course. I chose this single artifact as it provided a solid base to enhance my software design, algorithm, and database knowledge. This application started as a fairly basic app allowing for a user to login and input daily weights as well as weight goals. Overall, I was able to enhance the database allowing for users to edit or delete entries, adjust their weight goals, improve the user interface, and create an algorithm for automatically sorting entries. <br><br>

Prior to the Mobile Architecture course, I did not have any experience with Android Studio (used to develop the app) or application development in general. Previous courses such as CS-260 (Data Structures) and DAD 220 (Database Systems) gave me a solid starting foundation as to how to approach the enhancements required for the Capstone. I have not experienced working in a team environment throughout my program at SNHU, so all of the learning and knowledge I pulled in for my artifact was from classes I had taken previously. Utilizing the skills I obtained in CS-250 (Software Development Lifecycle) like the best practices and documentation of software, as well as the overall lifecycle of the development process, I was able to effectively update and enhance the weight tracking application appropriately.<br><br>

<h2>Code Review:</h2><br>
Completing a code review is crucial to a successful Computer Science project. It involves a quality assurance mindset by reviewing source code and the output of the code. As I walked through my code prior to starting any enhancements, it was clear that there were things that could be improved, such as the database structure, the user interface, and the overall structure of the code itself. This gave me a good foundation of ideas to help with my Capstone Artifact.
